Using Splunk i'm able to breakdown data and search individual datasets to track down information i am looking for. In this case i am looking for data that relates to an unknown attacker IP address "40.80.148.42" which is being used to attack a website called "iamnotbatman.com" who has the IP address of "192.168.250.70". Splunk is able to show all the events associated with the attacker IP and gives all the details of the source ip, destination ip, ports, and the time of the event. The search bar on top of the screen and fields on the left side of the screen, allow me to manage how i would like to identify IOCs.
